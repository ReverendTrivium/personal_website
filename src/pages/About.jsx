            I'm a Software Engineer and Team Lead with 8 years of experience building scalable, 
            cloud-based, and community-driven applications. My work spans full-stack development 
            with Java, JavaScript, React, and MongoDB, alongside integrations with APIs like Discord, 
            Google Calendar, and Spotify. I've led cross-functional teams to deliver web and mobile 
            apps on schedule, optimized databases for performance, and automated operations to 
            streamline workflows. Beyond engineering, I founded and scaled Tomodachi Street, a 
            DMV-based events group, where I developed custom tools, integrated open-source platforms, 
            and created immersive AV experiences to drive community growth. My portfolio reflects a 
            blend of technical depth, leadership, and creativityâ€”building not just applications, but 
            systems and communities that thrive.
            <br /><br />
            With a strong background in Software Engineering, I have extensive experience with technologies 
            such as Java, MySQL, C++, MongoDB, JavaScript, and HTML. I am currently expanding my skill 
            set to include cloud platforms like AWS and Microsoft Azure, as well as Machine Learning 
            and Artificial Intelligence.
          < br /><br />
            Outside of work, I enjoy cosplaying with friends, working on my car, skateboarding, and 
            challenging myself at the gym.
